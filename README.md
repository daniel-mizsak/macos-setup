## Overview
Setting up and making sure that macOS is configured properly and is ready for development.

## Getting started
First make sure that you are logged into the **App Store**.


The setup should execute automatically after running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniel-mizsak/macos-setup/HEAD/macos-setup.sh)"
```

The shell will ask for the password (possibly multiple times during the installation process).

After the first run, it is recommended to **restart** the computer and **run the script again** to make sure that everything is installed properly.
